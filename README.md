# Qurious Data Science
> a qurious quest for data science, with questions and curiosity.

Qurious Data Science aims to help learners develop their problem-solving skills in data science and competitive problem-solving while guiding them on how to build their careers in data science in this rapidly changing world. I heavily rely on creative people, who are constantly working on projects that can set examples for future generations, or help them learn and solve data science and competitive problems. If you know any, do let me know. Everything is free here, but the resources, I refer to may be paid like books/courses, etc.
