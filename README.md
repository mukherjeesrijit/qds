# Qurious Data Science
> a qurious quest for data science, with questions and curiosity.

**Qurious Data Science** aims to help learners develop their problem-solving skills in data science and competitive problem-solving while guiding them on how to build their careers in data science in this rapidly changing world. 

**Methodology:** My methodology is to help you understand and inspire you by showing you authentic examples. You can only learn from the difference between your approach, and the examples, that you look up to. The aim is to provide you will ample such examples, mostly mine, and my favourites. The following are the divisions of contribution.

* Content
> Build your foundations in data science

* Projects
> Learn from examples of data science projects

* Career
> Build your career in data science

* Podcasts
> Learn from those, who are doing it daily

* Competitive
> Build your competitive problem-solving skills

* Courses
> Learn from organized courses and curriculum

* Talks
> Listen to short talks and webinars for inspiration

**Note**: I heavily rely on creative people, who are constantly working on projects that can set examples for future generations, or help them learn and solve data science and competitive problems. If you know any, do let me know. Everything is and will be free here, but the resources, I refer to may be paid like books/courses, etc.
